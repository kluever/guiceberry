`GuiceBerry` brings the joys of dependency injection to your test cases and test infrastructure.  It leverages Guice to accomplish this.  It allows you to use a composition model for the services your test needs, rather than the traditional `extends MyTestCase` approach.

`GuiceBerry` does not supplant your JUnit testing framework -- it builds on top of it (and works around it, when necessary), so you can run your tests normally, from your favorite command line or IDE environment.
