How To release a new version of GuiceBerry (either read this or run howtorelease.sh for instructions)
==========================================

1. If you, say, upgraded libs, fix the tutorial docs as needed:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cyism50KXTMXcvYNbqUXi3gaaNKaXDgjXjpx4rPNet8/preview#heading=h.rh5udi32eepa

2. Before you proceed, make sure it's all committed:

$ git pull && git status

Make sure you have no untracked files, uncommitted changes, and that you are
not "ahead" of origin/master. If you are, you need to git push. Make sure you
have no compilation/test errors:

$ ant clean test dist

TODO: javadoc -- there's a couple of warnings that I can't seem to find out how to fix.

3. Update RELEASE_NOTES.md. Use "gitk --all" to see that all changes since the
last release are accounted for. Commit and push:

$ git commit -a -m "Release notes for x.y.z"; git push

4, Again run a paranoid:

$ git pull && git status

5. Then, run this:

$ echo -e "\n\n*** Changing build.properties: 'version=snapshot' to 'version=x.y.z'. " && \
  echo -e "\n\n*** This change is not to be committed into the master branch." && \
  sed --in-place s/version=snapshot/version=x.y.z/ build.properties && \
  echo -e "\n\n*** Building a dist (ant clean test dist)." && \
  ant clean test dist && \
  echo -e "\n\n*** Committing locally (the change to build.properties)." && \
  git commit -a -m "version=release x.y.z" && \
  echo -e "\n\n*** Creating a git tag named 'release-x.y.z'" && \
  git tag release-x.y.z && \
  echo -e "\n\n*** Resetting the local branch to where we want to keep master." && \
  git reset --hard HEAD~1 && \
  echo -e "\n\n*** Pushing the tag to github." && \
  git push origin release-x.y.z

6. Check that this is the right link to the current release notes:

https://github.com/zorzella/guiceberry/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md#guiceberry-xyz

7. Create a release in GitHub

https://github.com/zorzella/guiceberry/releases/new

Tag version: release-x.y.z (@ master)
Release title: GuiceBerry x.y.z
Describe this release: Release notes at https://github.com/zorzella/guiceberry/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md#guiceberry-xyz

Attach binaries (all of them can be found in the build/dist/guiceberry-x.y.z
directory) -- the order does not matter, just attach all of them at once:

guiceberry-x.y.z.jar
guiceberry-x.y.z-src.jar
guiceberry-x.y.z-tutorial.jar
guiceberry-x.y.z-javadoc.jar

8. Hit "Publish release"
